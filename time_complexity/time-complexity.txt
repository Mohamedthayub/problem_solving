Time complexity is  not taken 

for example :
there are two computer one is old macbook and another one is new macbook 
if you run  your a code in old macbook  that might take end to complete 3s 
the new macbook  might take end to complete 1s . this is why time complexity can't be
time taken

what is time complexity ?
